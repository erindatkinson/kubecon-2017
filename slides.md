# Take Aways
---
## Calico is what a lot of people are gravitating towards
We should migrate now before our usage ramps up
---
## We're going down the right path!

Curated Helm charts with a Values file as the deployment contract is a common pattern

Netflix had a shift from "Let me control every knob" to "Give me sane defaults"
---
## We're going down the right path!
`kubectl` is the new `ssh` If you're deploying to production with `kubectl` you are missing steps
Doing it right means that kubernetes is hidden to the developers
-Kelsey Hightower
---
## We're going down the right path!
* CodeKarma's Monolith -> Microservices
* 7 year old php monolith
* Started with small services outside the critical path
* Used linkerd to bridge the monolith and microservices
* [Slides](https://schd.ws/hosted_files/kccncna17/39/Monolith%20to%20Microservices%20-%20Kubecon%202017.pdf)
---
## We should be use OpenTracing
Its the Peanut Butter to the Service Mesh's Chocolate
---
## Documentation pipelining
* Intent is to have development groups take ownership of services as 3rd party APIs
* need a central hub for cross dissemination of contracts across teams
  * Swagger is a good reference documentation for many developers.
  * not all questions can be answered by swagger
    * long form documentation and api reference being in the same repo as the code pushes documentation best practices.
  * add documentation deploy as bundled part of service deploy
    * versioned to deployed service
---
## Helm CICD
* They use Gitlab ci-runners.
* A lot of caveats on how they use helm charts
  * for development:
    * Set max unavailable to 0 on 1 replicacount value
      * if someone wants to deploy with a replica count of 1
    * in regard to sane defaults
      * Flag for clients/splunk/DD logging sidecar.
        * Have option for custom sidecar
        * major amounts of code login in templates in helm charts
      * sane defaults if not flagged, if flag is set in values, then allow for modification.

### An engineer had a k8s cluster running on ARM SmartWatches
* Had custom built docker and kubelet on Astroid OS
* Ran a service to turn the screens from Red to Blue
---
## Cluster management API
